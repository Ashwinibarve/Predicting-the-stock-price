Project title  : Prediction of Stock  prices.
 Stock market is an important part of the economy of any country. The stock market plays a pivotal role in the growth of the industry
 and commerce of the country that eventually affects the economy of country to a great extent. The stock market is important from both 
 the industries point of view as well as investors point of view. It is easy to see that not only is data science used in stock analysis 
 in most instances it is the process of actually analyzing the stock. And so everyone is interested to predict the stock movements of
 their own organizations. 
Problem :
Prediction of the stock market is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction- physical
factors vs. physiological, rational, and irrational behavior etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and difficult
to predict with a high degree of accuracy. 
Solution :
In this project I am going to build a model to predict the movement of the stock price. To solve this problem, I am going to implement a 
mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of the company, starting with linear regression, K- nearest neighbors
and then move on to Auto ARIMA, Prophet.
Dataset :
In this project I will work with historical data about the stock prices of the publicly listed companies.
For this purpose I will be using dataset from Kaggle : Huge stock market Dataset.
This dataset will be analyzed using python.
