In this project am going to work on 
Problem :
Prediction of the stock market is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction- physical
factors vs. physiological, rational, and irrational behavior etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and difficult
to predict with a high degree of accuracy. 
Solution :
In this project I am going to build a model to predict the movement of the stock price. To solve this problem, I am going to implement a 
mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of the company, starting with linear regression, K- nearest neighbors
and then move on to Auto ARIMA, Prophet.
Dataset :
In this project I will work with historical data about the stock prices of the publicly listed companies.
For this purpose I will be using dataset from Kaggle : Huge stock market Dataset.
This dataset will be analyzed using python.



Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the 
prediction – physical factors vs. physhological, rational and irrational behaviour, etc. 
All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy.

Can we use machine learning as a game changer in this domain? Using features like the latest announcements about an organization,
their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see
before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions.we will work with historical data about the stock prices of a
publicly listed company. We will implement a mix of machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of this company,
starting with simple algorithms
like averaging and linear regression, and then move on to advanced techniques like Auto ARIM and linear regression .
